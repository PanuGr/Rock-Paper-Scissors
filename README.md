# Rock-paper-scissor game

In this project, I've been working a lot with if-statements, switch functions and array loops.

TDD test is written with Cypress.io. To run it, you need Node.js.

In your terminal, type `npm install` and when the download and installation finishes, type `npm cypress:open` or `npx cypress open`.

The after few seconds the cypress platform will start and you can run the test.
