# Implementing AI-Powered Difficulty Levels

## How the AI Integration Works

1. **Pattern recognition**: The AI analyzes your previous moves to predict what you'll play next  
2. **Difficulty levels**:  
   * **Easy**: AI occasionally makes deliberate mistakes  
   * **Medium**: Basic pattern recognition  
   * **Hard**: Uses the AI model to predict your next move  
   * **Adaptive**: Dynamically adjusts difficulty based on win rate

Add the difficulty selector UI to your game

## Advanced Features Shown in the Dashboard

The AI dashboard demonstrates how you could extend this concept with:

* Visual analytics of player patterns  
* Customizable difficulty settings  
* Game history with AI predictions  
* Win rate tracking

These features can be implemented incrementally as you develop the game further.
